        <b>GALAKROND</b> "He was the largest proto-dragon who had ever soared
        across Azeroth's skies. So mighty was the enormous creature that the
        beating of his wings could flatten entire forests." Galakrond was the
        largest proto-dragon of them all. With an insatiable hunger that
        actually drove him mad. Nothing could fill this beasts belly wich made
        him feast on his own felllow proto-drakes, slowly, turning him mad,
        almost corrupting his mind. Not long after he started to feast on his
        brethren he started growing necrotic limbs and dozens of old-god like
        eyes on his already afflicted form.

        <b>AMAN'THUL</b> He was the first one to wake up, all alone, in search
        for the rest of his kin. Not knowing they existed but feeling that there
        has to be more out there. Aman'thul, the founding father of the
        pantheon, set out to discover the other nascent world-souls. Searching,
        jumping from world-soul to world-soul he slowly but surely awoken what
        would eventually become his siblings. Aman'thul and his siblings later
        on being known as The Pantheon, set out to stabilize the worlds. The
        sole purpose of the Pantheon was to bring order to the worlds. They even
        embedded huge machines that you can see in different zones in the game.

        <b>TYR</b> During the battle against Galakrond Tyr suffered a heavy
        blow, even with the Dragon Aspects fighting alongside him. In a
        particular moment during the battle, the necrotic inflicted and
        corrupted Galakrond caught Tyr off-guard and bit off his iron hand,
        leaving an open wound. With all odds against him, Tyr luckily survived
        and replaced his lost hand with a newly forged one, one forged in pure
        silver. This newly forged mighty fist of pure silver would come to be a
        symbol and inspiration for personal sacrifice and justice. It is also
        where The Order of the Silver Hand took its name and symbol from.
